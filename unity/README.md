Unity example about receiving OSC data through WebSocket.

## WebSocket

[websocket-sharp](https://github.com/sta/websocket-sharp)

It's a C# implementation. I have built a `websocket-sharp.dll` and added it into `Assets/` folder.    
If the dll does not work for you, you can [build it yourself](https://github.com/sta/websocket-sharp#self-build).


## OSC data parse

There are serveral OSC libraries for Unity, but actually only OSC data packing and parsing (unpacking) is necessary here.   
[VVVVUnityOSC](https://github.com/frankiezafe/VVVVUnityOSC) has convenient methods to do this.

packing: `new OSCMessage("/unity/midi", 87).BinaryData`    
unpacking: `OSCPacket.Unpack(oscPacketRawData)`
